#### ASL-specifc startup scripts

#####Note: 
These start scripts are supposed to be minimum-working-examples! Therefore, 
 - modifications are still necessary to adapt them to each platform (mainly in section 1, "CONFIGURATION-SPECIFIC PARAMETERS" of the start script)
 - functionality that is not contained in our baseline firmware (i.e. master/stable) should not be pushed. For example, please do not push modified scripts in telem_config to contain messages that are only needed under certain conditions.
